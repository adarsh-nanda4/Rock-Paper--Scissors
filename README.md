The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a classic hand game usually played between two people. In this Java implementation, the game is played against the computer. The game starts by displaying a menu where the player can choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors. After the player makes a selection, the computer randomly selects one of the three options. The choices are then compared, and the winner is determined based on the rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock. The result of the round is displayed, indicating whether the player won, lost, or if it's a tie. The game continues until the player decides to quit. This implementation utilizes basic Java programming concepts such as user input, random number generation, conditional statements, and loops to create an interactive and entertaining game experience.
